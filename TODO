Convert all uses of `error' to have a proper symbol indicator

`display', `newline', `write' etc -> `printf'
  Specifically, some are used before showing errors, which might lead to
  confusing output since the display goes to stdout, and the error goes
  to stderr

Convert the (define foo (lambda (...) ...))s

use structs

Typo in error message:
  (error "The variable ,var was not found in the frame" frame)

Mess: `lookup-variable-value' and `defined-in-env' mess: why return a
frame instead of the value??  (Also mess in using an empty env
essentially as a flag for raising an exception later.)

`get-sub-frame' in the imperative interpreter keeps building bogus
frames that are boxes, but these boxes are not intended to be changed.
